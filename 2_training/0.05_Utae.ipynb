    "The idea is simple: If we change the n-th input sample, it should only have an effect on the n-th output. If other outputs i ≠ n also change, the model mixes data and that’s not good! A reliable way to implement this test is to compute the gradient on the n-th output with respect to all inputs. The gradient must be zero for all i ≠ n (red in the animation above) and nonzero for i = n (green in the animation above). If these conditions are met, the model passes the test. Below is the implementation for n = 3:"
